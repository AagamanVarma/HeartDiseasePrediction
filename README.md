#  Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning and Explainable AI

This project presents a machine learning approach to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient health metrics. It compares multiple models and uses SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to explain model predictions.

##  Overview
- 📊 Models Used: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, KNN, Gradient Boosting
- ⚙️ Tools: Python, Google Colab, scikit-learn, SHAP
- 🎯 Dataset: Heart Disease dataset (from Kaggle)
- 📈 Best Model: SVM (Accuracy: 87.5%)
- 📄 Research Paper: LaTeX document included in the repo



##  How to Run
1. Upload `heart.csv` to your Colab environment
2. Open the notebook `heart_disease_prediction.ipynb`
3. Run all cells to train and evaluate models
4. SHAP summary plots explain feature importance

##  Sample Outputs
- Model accuracies
- Confusion matrix
- SHAP summary plot

## Project Goal
To demonstrate an accurate, interpretable ML model for predicting heart disease using simple clinical features. SHAP is used to make the black-box models more transparent.

##  Future Work
- Add deep learning models
- Test on larger or real-world datasets
- Deploy as a web app for hospital use
